Engineering won\u2014and then he discovered the P-LEGS project at the University of Houston. P-LEGS is a robotic exoskeleton designed to rehabilitate young children with mobility disabilities, giving them the chance to walk when their bodies can't do it alone. Rodriguez applied to UH specifically to work with principal investigator Jose Luis Contreras-Vidal on this project. \"Helping people is something I want to do the rest of my life,\" Rodriguez said.
