      "extended_summary": "The thermometer read -19\u00b0F overnight, cold enough that a gust of wind could kill an unsheltered person in minutes. Green Bay's warming shelters were turning people away. So Safe Haven Pet Sanctuary, which typically cares for blind and disabled cats, threw open its doors to humans too. \"A cat will warm your heart and your lap, too. Come on in and warm up. All are welcome,\" said board president Joe Becker. A local pastor and her husband volunteered to stay overnight supervising arrivals, turning a small nonprofit into an emergency lifeline when the system failed.",

The transformation began when Fire Battalion Chief Ben Jones sent a team to train at Seattle's Resuscitation Academy, bringing back a \"chain of survival\" plan: rapid recognition, immediate CPR, fast AED access, and quick transport. McKinney's fire and police departments coordinated their response, and now the city is placing automated external defibrillators directly into neighborhoods, creating one of the nation's first \"4-Minute Cities.\" The goal: an AED within four minutes of any cardiac event, anywhere in the city.
