      "extended_summary": "The gymnasium filled with boxes, canned goods, and dozens of students working assembly-line style to pack meal kits for families struggling to afford groceries. But Poly Prep didn't stop at packing\u2014students and staff loaded up cars and drove the food directly to people's doors, turning what could have been a detached charity project into face-to-face encounters that made the need real and immediate. For many students, it was their first time seeing how close hunger is to their own neighborhoods, how normal the families looked, how much a bag of food and a genuine conversation mattered. The deliveries didn't solve food insecurity, but they cracked open the bubble and got young people thinking differently about who their community includes.",
