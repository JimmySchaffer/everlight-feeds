Ed Lewis grabbed his shovel, cleared a few sidewalks himself, then realized he could do more. Within hours, the web engineer launched Snow Patrol \u2014 a free app that lets anyone in Marblehead flag dangerous uncleared spots and mark them resolved once someone shovels. No bylaw requires snow removal in this Massachusetts town, so Lewis turned to neighbors instead. At least 11 people signed on within days, quietly reclaiming their sidewalks one shovel at a time.",

Through the Big Orange Combine program, they spent game day behind the scenes, networking with hundreds of industry professionals and gaining hands-on experience in human resources and sports management. Faculty advisor Dr. Debra Mackey has overseen the program for over a decade, watching it evolve from a small sports management opportunity into a major experiential learning platform. For these students, the Super Bowl became less about the halftime show and more about stepping outside their comfort zones and building careers.",

Then he went through Monongalia County Teen Court, where something unusual happened: he stood before a courtroom run entirely by his peers. Teen attorneys, jurors, bailiffs, and clerks\u2014all volunteers trained by local legal professionals\u2014heard his case and determined his sentence. Less than a year later, his report card shows mostly As and Bs, a 40% improvement. He's excited to start high school and study music. Since 2018, Teen Court has offered local youth a chance to take control of their futures, proving that sometimes the best judges are the ones who understand what it's like to make mistakes.",

Design your own workday around when you're most productive\u2014early mornings and traditional school hours in this case, ending around 3:30 or 4 p.m. when energy dips.

Expect to do things wrong when trying something new\u2014and be okay with it. The risk of imperfection is worth the reward of learning.",
